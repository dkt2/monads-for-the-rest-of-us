 * KerPlunk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KerPlunk_%28game%29
 *
 * KerPlunk is a game where you hold up marbles with sticks
 *  and then take turn taking out sticks without letting the marbles through.
 * The person who lets the most marbles through loses.
 *
 * A similar problem exists in software engineering where,
 *  in the process of implementing business logic, you may end up creating a nest of if-thens
 *  which is hard to reason about and verify its correctness.
 *
 * Although this problem doesn't overlap with traditional computer science fields of study,
 *  this problem has a lot of in common with them.
 *
 * Prolog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog
 *
 * A notable prior art in this area is the Prolog programming language. It was originally invented as an AI system
 *  whereby programmers to encode "real world" information by programming in the language, and then when
 *  a sufficient amount of knowledge had been programmed the program would exhibit general-level intelligence.
 *
 * Prolog didn't (or at least hasn't yet) turned out to be the solution to AI, but it's ideas are useful for
 *  solving other problems; namely this one.
 *
 * Although it might seem obvious now in the current age of neural networks (such as GPT-4),
 *  a way of representing knowledge can be a graph (aka a network).
 * Often times, facts are not as important as how the facts relate to each other.
 * For example, knowing a person's name is useful but knowing their relationships to you and other people in your life
 *  is more valuable then just knowing a person's name in isolation.
 * Another example is mechanical engineering, knowing individual physics laws is useful but understand how to
 *  connect those laws together to build bridges is argubly more valuable.
 *
 * Metcalfe's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law.
 *
 * SnapChat proposed sell for 3 billion dollars:
 *  https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-did-snapchat-turn-down-three-billion-dollars.
 *
 * This is the basis of Metcalfe's law, and the reason why a social network can be sold for 3 billion dollars.
 * Indiviual facts combined are greater than the sum of their parts, and it is often the case in the "real world"
 *  that we care more about and derive more value from the connections than the nodes.
 *
 * Prolog was essentially a programming language for creating a graph
 *  (or network if you will) of all of human knowledge.
 * Its propose solution to AI was that it was simply a search on this graph.
 * An idea that was floating around the time the first neural network was invented as well.
 *
 * This is all a long way to say that the If-Then KerPlunk problem is really a graph traversal problem.
 * A series of If-Then's is actually a flowchart which is actually a state machine.
 * Indeed, if you remember programming 101, one of the first tools given to new learners is the flowchart
 *  for mapping out algorithms before they are implemented.
 *
 * So then do we need to break out the graph and graph traversal algorithms?
 *
 * You can if you want! But I propose a simpler solution: monads.
 *
 * Monad: A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?
 *
 * It may not be immediately clear why or how monads can be the solution if you don't understand
 *  the mathethical background of them.
 * I don't fully understand it either, but here are some cliff notes.
 * Monads come from a mathematical field of study called Category Theory.
 * Category Theory is the study of abstractions.
 * Lets set that aside and give a more helpful intuition.
 *
 * Here's a brain teaser: how does 1 become 2?
 * You might say "by adding 1 to it: 1 + 1 = 2".
 * This is one of the central theme of Category Theory and software engineering.
 * In order to make useful things happen,
 *  we have to make up objects (1) and then we make up rules on those objects (1 + 1 = 2).
 *
 * A Monad is just the concept that an object and be transformed into another object.
 * It is literally the idea that if that take an (object) number "1"
 *  and you "add" another (object) number to it, "1",
 *  that the resulting (object) number is "2".
 *
 * Hopefully you understand now why Monads are a cool idea for a software engineer,
 *  but if not let me explain by returning to our original problem.
